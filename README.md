# scattr

This is a light weight server that users an incoming http request as a trigger to initiate http requests to one or more configured end points, waits until it receives responses for each such request and then combines the individual responses to prepare the final consolidated response for the original request. Custom logic can be scripted via JavaScript to control how the individual responses are processed.
Scattr has builtin admin interface to easily  add / remove endpoint and filter scripts .
